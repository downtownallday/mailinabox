# Mail-in-a-Box LDAP
This is a version of [Mail-in-a-Box](https://mailinabox.email) with LDAP used as the user account database instead of sqlite.

All features are supported - you won't find many visible differences. It's only an under-the-hood change.

However, it will allow a remote Nextcloud installation to authenticate users against Mail-in-a-Box using [Nextcloud's official LDAP support](https://nextcloud.com/usermanagement/). A single user account database shared with Nextcloud was originally the goal of the project which would simplify deploying a private mail and cloud service for a home or small business. But, there could be many other use cases as well. 

To add a new account to Nextcloud, you'd simply add a new email account with MiaB-LDAP's admin interface. Quotas and other account settings are made within Nextcloud.

## How to connect to a remote Nextcloud
---------------------------------

To integrate Mail-in-a-Box w/LDAP (MiaB-LDAP) with Nextcloud, changes must be made on both sides.  These changes are automated.

**On MiaB-LDAP**

Enable the setup mod `remote-nextcloud.sh` by creating the directory `local` in the directory where mailinabox is installed (usually $HOME/mailinabox), then creat a symbolic link to remote-nextcloud.sh. e.g. run this command from the mailinabox directory: `mkdir -p local; ln -s ../setup/mods.available/remote-nextcloud.sh local/remote-nextcloud.sh`. *During setup you will be prompted for the hostname and web prefix of your remote Nextcloud box.*

The setup mod will configure Roundcube and Z-Push (ActiveSync) to use the remote Nextcloud for contacts and calendar instead of the local Nextcloud, which will be disabled (browsing to /cloud will fail).

**On the remote Nextcloud**

Copy the file `setup/mods.available/remote-nextcloud-use-miab.sh` to the Nextcloud box and run it. This will configure Nextcloud's "LDAP user and group backend" with the MiaB-LDAP details and ensure the contacts and calendar apps are installed. *This does not replace or alter your ability to log into Nextcloud with any existing local Nextcloud accounts. It only allows MiaB-LDAP users to log into Nextcloud using their MiaB-LDAP credentials.*

**Additional Firewall Rule**

On MiaB-LDAP, a one-time change must be applied manually to allow the remote Nextcloud to query the LDAP server because the default MiaB-LDAP installation doesn't allow any remote LDAP access. As root, run the following: `ufw allow proto tcp from $ip to any port ldaps`, where $ip is the ip-address of your Nextcloud server.


## Under-the-Hood

**Additional directory in user-data**

A new ldap directory is created by setup under STORAGE_ROOT (/home/user-data/ldap) that holds the LDAP database, so that it gets backed up by the normal backup process. In there, you will also find all LDAP service account credentials created by setup in `/home/user-data/ldap/miab_ldap.conf`, such as those for Nextcloud. Service accounts have limited rights to make changes and should be preferred over the use of the LDAP admin account.

**LDAP schema for postfix and dovecot**

See `conf/postfix.schema` for more details on the LDAP schema.

**LDAP logs**

LDAP server logs are stored in `/var/log/ldap/slapd.log` and rotated daily.

**Command line queries**

To perform general command-line searches against your LDAP database, run `setup/ldap -search "\<query\>"` as root, where _query_ can be a distinguished name to show all attributes of that dn, or an LDAP search enclosed in parenthesis. Some examples:
  * `setup/ldap.sh -search "(mail=alice@mydomain.com)"` (show alice)
  * `setup/ldap.sh -search "(|(mail=alice.*)(mail=bruce.*))"` (show all alices and bruces)
  * `setup/ldap.sh -search "(objectClass=mailuser)"` (show all users)
  * etc.

This is a convenient way to run ldapsearch having all the correct command line arguments, but any LDAP tool will also work.

**Caution**

*Do not make direct LDAP database changes, such as adding users or groups using ldapmodify or other LDAP database tools. Instead, use the MiaB admin interface or REST API. Adding or removing a user or group with the admin interface may trigger additional database and system changes by the management daemon, such as updating DNS zones for new email domains, updating group memberships, etc, that would not be performed with a direct change.*


## Migration
---------
Running any of the setup scripts to install MiaB-LDAP (`miab`, `setup/bootstrap.sh`, `setup/start.sh`, etc) will automatically migrate your current installation from sqlite to LDAP. Make a full MiaB backup before running!
